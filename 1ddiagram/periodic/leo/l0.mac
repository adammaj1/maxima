Adam, if I understand your code, you solve for a periodic point z as a
function of the parameter c. An alternative is to solve for c as a
function of z. This has a 2-fold advantage: 1. where the bifurcations
occur, you see vertical tangents in z vs. c, with a consequent loss of
resolution (few data points on each branch)--these vertical tangents
become horizontal in c vs. z so there is no loss of resolution; 2. As
a polynomial in c, the degree is half that of the degree in z, which
should speed calculations.

It may seem weird to treat the parameter as the dependent variable,
but this is a standard trick in the analysis of bifurcations.
